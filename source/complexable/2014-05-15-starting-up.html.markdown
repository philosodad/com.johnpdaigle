I recently attempted, with a friend of mine, to start up a start-up. And as it turns out, the hardest thing about this is not finding an idea, or building the product. It's believing hard enough to build the product.

When you do something risky, it's just incredibly easy to talk yourself out of it, or to feel like you have to dot every i and cross every t before you get started. But of course, you don't have to do that at all. You can build whatever you want, however you want, with 'i's and 't's in whatever shape you want them to be in. Because the worst thing that can happen to you in the startup space is that you can fail... and failure is a pretty good option.

It's not just that you learn from failure. That's obvious enough. It's that you gain from failure. You gain whatever contacts you made on your way to failing, for example. You also gain a certain amount of credibility from failure. If you fail hard, you know what didn't work. Other people who don't want to fail hard want to know what those lessons were. Failure is a career builder.

But if you never get started at all, you never fail, and if you never fail, you don't get the great benefits of failure. Which is why this blog is more of a personal appeal than anything else, a challenge to my almost-business partner.

You know where to find me. Let's get this product out there.
