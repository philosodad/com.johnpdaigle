Most of the time, I try to write about things that are relevant to development, agile development if I can manage it. And as a consequence, this blog is pretty sparse, because I spent an inordinate amount of my time thinking about sports. A lot of the time, I'm thinking about little league baseball because my son, The Highlander, plays little league. His team lost the local championship game for 7-8 year olds today. He doesn't seem to shaken up about it, he's downstairs right now practicing his swing with one of those hit-away contraptions. Overall, there was a lot of crying from the team overall, probably a result of the huge amounts of pressure that the coaches put the kids under. We shouldn't, and we try not to, but it's hard. Emotions run high in championship games.

I gues we aren't particularly bad offenders when it comes to this sort of thing. I mean, you hear about guys getting into fistfights with the umpire, or the other teams coaches, or other coaches on their own team. So in the grand scheme of taking our kids sporting events too seriously, the collective parents of the East Point Red Sox aren't an exteme case. Not that we should be proud of stopping short of actual insanity, but it's something.

It's one thing to get emotionally involved in a sporting event when you know the participants. I don't understand why I'm emotionally involved in sporting events where I not only don't know the players, I don't even live in the same world as the players. Professional sports, at least, top tier professional sports like Major League Baseball or the NFL or the NBA, are played between teams of freakishly talented, outsized, wealthy men. There has been no point in my life where I've had anything at all in common with these people, and yet, I watch them play and judge their performance and to some degree empathize with their wins and losses and triumphs and travails. It's an odd thing, empathy.
